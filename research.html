						<h3>Why galaxy morphology?</h3>

						<p>I am interested in understanding how galaxies evolved across the cosmic history. Galaxies have many different shapes and sizes, and we believe that their shapes (or in more technical astronomical terms "morphologies") are related to how these galaxies formed and evolved. For example elliptical galaxies have ellipsoidal shapes, with a smooth brightness profile and without containing much structure. They are typically redder in colour because they contain older stars and have little to no new stars forming. On the other hand there are disc galaxies, which are flat, are typically blue in colour and contain a lot of inner structure, for example bars, bulges, spiral arms, rings etc. My research so far focused on investigating the properties of these inner structures in order to learn how they formed and evolved to be the wat they are, as well as to find out what is their impact on the galaxies they `live' in. </p> 

						<a name="galaxyzoo"></a>
						<h3>The largest structures in the Universe</h3>

						<p><img src="https://lprichard.github.io/images/abell1689.jpg" class="image fit right" /></a>
						A great tool to identify the inner structure of galaxies is using visual inspection. In past, catalogues of classified galaxies were compiled by teams of astronomers, however, with the advent of the large astronomical surveys, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, this has become impractical. The crowdsourcing Galaxy Zoo project attempts to solve this problem by setting up an online crowdsourcing project and asking the volunteers to classify the galaxies, according to a classification tree (seen below). The "citizen science" approach (named accordingly because the public is involved in genuine scientific research) allows making huge catalogues of hundreds of thousand of classified galaxies, with individual galaxies being inspected by several volunteers. These large catalogues can provide sufficiently large training sets for future machine learning algotirhms to classify even larger sets of data, such as those from the Large Synoptic Sky Survey (LSST).

						My research focuses on the detailed morphology provided by the volunteers for the disc galaxies. In Galaxy Zoo, we do not assign a particular morphology to a galaxy, but rather a probability or likelihood for a galaxy to have a particular feature by computing the ratio of the number of people saying the galaxy has the feature over the total number of people who answered the question. For example, if 5 out of 10 people said that a galaxy has a bar, this galaxy will have a `bar probability' of 50%. We also take into account observational biases, such that galaxies that are further away appear dimmer and smaller and correct this probability for such effects.</p>

						<a name="decomposition"></a>
						<h3>Galaxy decomposition</h3> 
					
						<p><img src="https://lprichard.github.io/images/kmos.jpg" class="image fit right" =/></a>

						For a long time astronomers wanted to assign some numbers to the particular morphology of galaxies in order to understand how the light is distributed in a galaxy. They came up with all sorts of functions to describe this, the most famous one being the Sersic function which is a general mathematical function describing how the intensity varies with radius. Paticular cases are the exponential functions used to describe the brightness profile of disc galaxies, and the de Vaucoulers profile used to describe the light profile of elliptical galaxies. 

						A galaxy decomposition software computes a parametric model to describe this light profile of galaxies in images, while being able to account for the multitude of features present in a galaxy. However, this approach is difficult without human supervision, the most common automatic decomposition is into a bulge and a disc (called "B/D decompositions"). The meaning of "bulge" in these decompositions is the innermost component of galaxies rather than the morphological component known as the bulge. 

						In my work, I have attempted to extend the automatic B/D decompositions by adding a bar component, using prior knowledge about the galaxies provided by the volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project. The advantage of this is being able to study a large sample of galaxies by combining visual inspection with automatic decompositions and getting more robust and reliable parameters. For the fitting I have been using a modified version of Galfit, GalfitM, which allows fitting multiple bands simultaneously and getting information from all across the optical spectrum. The advantage of this is being able to study both the blue band which captures the newly formed stars, as well as the redder bands probing the older stellar populations. 

						In this paper I explained this method in fitting ~3,500 barred galaxies with multi-components and in multiple wavelengths. I explored the colours of the different galaxy structures (discs, bars and bulges), finding that the inner components (bars, bulges) have redder colours compared to the discs which suggests that the inner regions are, in general, `red and dead'. Also, comparing to a similar sample of galaxies without bars, the discs of barred galaxies are redder, suggestive of them being depleted of gas by the bars and the star formation decreasing. I have also noticed two types of bars in these galaxies - smaller, late-type galaxies have exponential bars, while more massive, early-type galaxies have galaxies with a flatter radial light profile. Finally, I have found a population of galaxies without bars with another feature in the proximity of their bulges - "inner lenses" (not gravitational lenses, but rather circular "plateaus" in the light profiles) that have more similar properties to barred galaxies. This suggests a possible link between bars and lenses, but the exact nature of this link is still unclear. As with many other topics of research, this study raises many other questions.</p>

						<h3>MaNGA survey</h3>

						<p>


							I have been working as part of the KMOS guaranteed observing program, the KMOS Cluster Survey (KCS; P.I.s Bender &amp; Davies), during my PhD. The aim of KCS was to study the evolution of galaxies in dense environments i.e. clusters of galaxies, between redshifts 1 &lt; <i>z</i> &lt; 2. These distant clusters provide a valuable opportunity to observe evolving galaxies in the early Universe. The clusters are also sufficiently dense so that multiple targets can be observed efficiently with KMOS. To study the properties of the galaxies, we obtained deep absorption-line spectra, observing individual cluster galaxies for over 20 hours each with the 24 IFUs of KMOS. These spectra, when combined with <i>Hubble Space Telescope</i> (HST) images, then enabled us to derive the kinematics, masses, and ages of the stellar populations in the galaxies (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2016MNRAS.458.3181C/abstract">Chan et al. 2016</a>, 2017, submitted, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017arXiv170800454B/abstract">Beifiori et al. 2017</a>, Prichard et al. 2017, submitted). (Images: Four clusters from the KCS sample spanning 1.39 &lt; <i>z</i> &lt; 1.80, with names, redshifts, and sources shown.)<img src="https://lprichard.github.io/images/kcs.jpg" class="image fit" /></p>

						<p>My work as part of KCS has been focussed on the highest redshift cluster in the sample, JKCS 041. It was discovered from X-rays emitted by its hot intracluster medium by <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2009A&A...507..147A/abstract">Andreon et al. (2009)</a> and spectroscopically confirmed at <i>z</i> = 1.80 by <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2014ApJ...788...51N/abstract">Newman et al. (2014)</a>. In my recently submitted paper, building on the work in Beifiori et al. 2017 of the analysis of three KCS clusters, we investigated the properties of the galaxies and the dynamics of JKCS 041 to understand its galaxy and cluster formation. In order to determine stellar ages of the galaxies, we used the relation between the size, velocity dispersion, and the surface brightness of elliptical galaxies; this is called the fundamental plane (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/1987ApJ...313...59D/abstract">Djorgovski &amp; Davis 1987</a>, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/1987ApJ...313...42D/abstract">Dressler et al. 1987</a>). Assuming that the size and dispersion of galaxies does not change largely over cosmological time, this plane will evolve with the age of the stellar population of the galaxy as the massive bluer stars die off. From the cluster dynamics, morphology, and galaxy stellar age results, we see a hint of a cluster in formation consisting of two merging groups. This could link the ages of galaxies to large scale structure of the cosmic web for the first time at this redshift. This work provides an interesting snap shot into the early life of cluster galaxies undergoing transformations at early cosmological times.</p>

						<h3>Emission-line stars in the Andromeda Galaxy</h3>

						<p>The stellar content of a galaxy can reveal information about the way it has formed. The properties of stars, their colours, how bright they are, and whether they show an excess or lack of light at different wavelengths (i.e. emission or absorption lines in their spectrum), can tell us how massive a star is, its chemical composition, age, environment, and even the evolution of the wider galaxy in which it resides. One particularly useful element, due to its abundance in the Universe, is hydrogen. If a star shows a hydrogen emission line, this can reveal some key properties about the star and the physics driving the emission. The best way to study the stellar content of galaxies is to look at the individual stars themselves, however due to the vast distances of the cosmos this is only possible in the very local neighbourhood of our own galaxy. The Milky Way is in a gravitationally bound group of galaxies called the Local Group along with our similar but more massive spiral neighbour, the Andromeda Galaxy or Messier 31 (M31). In a project of unprecedented proportions aimed at characterising the stellar populations and properties of M31, the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey resolved around a third of the disk of M31 in to more than 100 million stars (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2012ApJS..200...18D/abstract">Dalcanton et al. 2012</a>). Spectra of ~15,000 stars from the PHAT survey were observed as part of the Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo (SPLASH) survey (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2012ApJ...752..147D/abstract">Dorman et al. 2012</a>) to investigate the properties of stars in PHAT and kinematics of M31 in vast detail.</p>

						<!-- The advantage of studying M31 is that we have an external view of a spiral galaxy, whereas living in the dust-rich disk of our own galaxy, we are obscured from seeing the rest of it.  -->

						<p><img src="https://lprichard.github.io/images/m31_els.jpg" class="image fit left" />In <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017MNRAS.465.4180P/abstract">Prichard et al. 2017</a>, we utilised this immense catalogue of six-filter HST data from PHAT and SPLASH spectroscopic data from one of the world's largest optical telescopes (the <a href="http://www.keckobservatory.org/">Keck Observatory</a> on Mauna Kea in Hawaii), to understand the properties of hydrogen emission-line stars in Andromeda. We discovered five distinct categories of emission-line stars which gave insights into stellar evolution, their local environments, and physical processes in the stars. Some of these stars could also be used to measure distances due to their use as standard candles. One subset of these stars revealed potential clues as to the evolution of the whole of M31 and we found that it could have had a more violent accretion and formation history than our own galaxy. This study showed the importance of understanding galaxy evolution down to the stellar level as a means of unravelling their histories.

						<h3>The initial mass function (IMF) of IC 1459</h3>

						<p>How a galaxy forms in the early Universe is still not well understood. Whether it collapses from a huge cloud of dust and gas and fragments into its first stars, or whether smaller galaxies combine together to become the massive galaxies we see today, or whether there are alternate mechanisms altogether is still not clearly known. A key way to understand how galaxies assemble is to probe the light from the stars within it. Beyond the reaches of the Local Group, this becomes harder as we cannot resolve individual stars but instead look at their combined light. Understanding the stellar content can then become difficult as the most massive stars (~1% of the mass) can dominate the light from the system as a whole. We need to understand the stellar composition of the galaxy not only to shed light on how it formed, but also in order to derive its stellar mass &mdash; most basic of properties that we know heavily influences or helps us understand its evolutionary path. The number of stars of each mass that make up a galaxy when it was first formed is called the initial mass function (IMF). What this function looks like for galaxies of all shapes, sizes, ages, and masses is one of the most important yet still disputed aspects of astronomy today. Where we struggle is constraining the very faintest end of the IMF for low-mass stars. Fortunately for us, these low-mass stars have certain elements that are sensitive to surface gravity, so that some absorption features in their spectrum actually appear stronger in the lowest mass stars. We can therefore utilise these features to weigh the contribution of low-mass stars in the galaxies.</p>

						<p><img src="https://lprichard.github.io/images/IC1459_color.jpg" class="image fit right" />To investigate the IMF and to test whether it is universal (i.e. the same for all different types of systems at different formation epochs), one can look in detail at the relics left from formation or 'fossil record' of elliptical galaxies in the local Universe. These galaxies with very little dust and gas mean you can probe the stellar light of the galaxy. To measure the IMF across the surface of one of these galaxies might be able to show us if different parts of the galaxies have varying proportions of low-mass stars, and thus reveal information about its formation history. I have been working with KMOS data in the little utilised mosaic mode to study a bright, local elliptical galaxy, IC 1459 to test these ideas. This galaxy is a famous example of one with a counter-rotating core (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/1988ApJ...327L..55F/abstract">Franx &amp; Illingworth 1988</a>); the stars in the inner part of the galaxy are rapidly counter rotating to the ionised gas and the stars in the outer region. This interesting system is therefore an ideal laboratory in which to test the universality of the IMF across its kinematically distinct components, and to understand its formation history.
